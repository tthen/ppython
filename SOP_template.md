- Resources and materials that the employees will need to complete the procedures

- Cautions and warnings related to the procedures or materials used in the process

# Procedures section. 

This is the essence of your SOP. Here you describe what needs to be done, the order of the tasks, and methodology your employees need to follow. You can list the different steps and if the process is more complex, include sub-steps to describe all activities in detail.Also, include supplementary diagrams, images, or illustrations when appropriate. Imagery can sometimes be a more effective way of explaining how to get things done.

# Quality control and assurance. Your employees can keep track of their performance on a case-by-case basis or over time by consulting with this section which includes:

- Best practices related to a specific procedure

- Guidelines on how to measure their performance

- Samples of previous results

- References and glossary. Here you can include all the terms, resources, and documents you might bring up in the procedure section. This is especially helpful if you’re onboarding a new hire, and they’re not familiar with a lot of the concepts.
